[case]
description = One of the form types in the .fec file is "SC/10".
    When using the C CLI, this results in a file "SC-10.csv".
    When using the Python `parse_as_files()` this results in "SC-10.csv".
    When using the Python `parse()` the form type returned in a line
    of the output is "SC/10".
    We need to check that this is handled correctly.
